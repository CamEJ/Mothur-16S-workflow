# how to make a nicely formatted .biom file for reading mothur data into R and other software

# you will need to have the biom convert software installed to make this work. 
# http://biom-format.org/index.html

# first step is to make the .biom file in mothur

mothur > make.biom(shared=stability.opti_mcc.0.03.subsample.shared, constaxonomy=stability.cons.taxonomy)


# Output File Names: 
# stability.opti_mcc.0.03.subsample.0.03.biom

# then, out of mothur, in command line (this is for linux system)

# 1 navigate to the folder where your .biom file was just created 

# 2 run the following command changing what is before -i and after -o as appropriate
# where -i means name of input file and -o is whatever name you want to give to output file


biom convert -i stability.an.0.03.subsample.0.03.biom -o table.from_biom_w_taxonomy.txt --to-tsv --header-key taxonomy

# will output a tab delimited OTU table called 'table.from_biom_w_taxonomy.txt' which has
# OTU number and taxonomy
